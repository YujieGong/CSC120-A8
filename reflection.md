Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
A drone is created as a class object. During the inlcass discussion with Lynne and Vivian, we tried to think about which object can both fly and walk, and we think about the drone, so we decided to work on the same oject but approach it through different ways. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I implemented a walking method, because the walk method only can return a boolean type so I used it to check if the drone is within the range, and the walking method is created to change the location of the drone. 

It is same as the flying method I created. The method is created to change the location and height and the fly method in the contract is used to evaluate if the number user inputs is a proper distance for the drone to fly. 

The on_or_off method is created to turn the drone on and off, and also measure the current percent of battery usage of the drone. 

The percent consuming method is created to get the input of how much time the drone is used and to calculate how much power is reduced according to the time.

The charging method is created to change the percent of battery of the drone according to the time it is being charged. 

The toString method is created to give basic information about the drone to the user. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think the code worked properlly and compiled successfully but some exceptional are not considered in the process of writing the code which needs to consider the number the user might input which makes the program crash. 

I think one suggestion would be discuss with the people around to see possible object that can implement all the methods in the contract.
